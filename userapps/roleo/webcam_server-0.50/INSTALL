webcam_server (c) 2002 Donn Morrison
====================================

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Installation should be as easy as unpacking the files and running the
following commands:

./configure
make
make install


Setting up the Client Applet
----------------------------

Once you've installed the webcam_server binary, you will need to place
the client applet (applet.jar) in a public location.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- You need a web server to use the applet.
- The applet must reside on the same host that your webcam_server is
  running on. This is an applet security measure used to disallow
  applets to connect to unauthorized hosts.

If your web root is /var/www, you can create a directory called 'client' and
place the 'src/client/webcam.html' and 'src/client/applet.jar' files in this
directory.


Using the Client Application
----------------------------

A standalone Java application in 'src/client/applet.jar' provides a viewer
you can use to watch a webcam_server stream. Usage follows:

java -classpath applet.jar WebCam localhost 8888

You can use this to view any webcam_server stream.

Depending on your Java installation, you might need to provide the classpath to
the standard Java classes. On my system this is
'/usr/lib/jdk1.1/lib/classes.zip'. You may have to use something like this:

java -classpath applet.jar:/usr/lib/jdk1.1/lib/classes.zip WebCam localhost 8888


Testing the Installation
------------------------

You can test the server by running it with no command line arguments (provided
your video device is /dev/video0):

webcam_server

Check that the server is working correctly by opening a web browser and using
the following URL:

http://localhost:8888

You should see an image captured from your video device on /dev/video0.


Command line Parameters
-----------------------

To get a list of command line parameters, consult the webcam_server man page
or use the following command:

webcam_server -h
